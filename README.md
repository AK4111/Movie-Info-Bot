I have build a very simple bot using Python.
A Telegram based chatbot that uses OMDB-API for retrieving the movie ratings that is  requested and sends it back to the user in the Telegram chat window.

__TELEGRAM BOT__

On the surface, Telegram is just another messaging app. The app promotes itself as secure, fast, ad-free, etc. However, there is one feature that sets it apart from similar apps: bots! 

## Why Create a Bot?

First, I will discuss what bots are and why you might be interested in creating one.

The term “bots” might call to mind those scripted auto-reply “live chat” programs we’ve all seen, but they’re not the same. These guys are amazing little helpers you can use in any chat.
Think of a bot as an automated user account that can do favors for you.

## How to Create Your First Bot

First, register on Telegram. I recommend using [Telegram web client](https://web.telegram.org) to test the basic concepts.

Open the Telegram app, search for ***@BotFather*** and start the chat. Send */newbot*  and follow the instructions. After completing the initial steps, you’ll get:

    - your TOKEN
    - the telegram api URL — https://api.telegram.org/bot
    - link on documentation


The bot is hosted online on [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/?c=7013A000000ib1xQAA&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4s7qBRCzARIsAImcAxYsAykyEAEp-XvXf4296_Fwvs1rHwDQV_CmB5MD8p6RZ52xdYQNV6gaAmKgEALw_wcB).

## Getting started with Telegram Bots 

Chatbots are fun, and Telegram has one of the best APIs to make one. This project uses the python-telegram-bot wrapper which provides a Python interface for the Telegram API.
